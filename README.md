# Predicting House Prices

This multiple linear regression project was completed as part of Moringa School Data Science Bootcamp (Phase 2 Final Project).

## Problem statement
Sometimes investors know how certain metrics and attributes affect house pricing, but they are not sure to what extent the metrics affect the pricing. Additionally, there are a combination of factors that affect the overall pricing of the houses. Unfortunately, the investors also cannot tell how the different combinations may affect the house pricing. They struggle to decide how much to price the houses based on the different combinations, and the random assumption may lead to overpricing or underpricing of the units

## Components

* **Jupyter Notebook**
The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Wairimukimm/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-3/blob/main/student.ipynb) is our key deliverable and contains details of our approach and methodology, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and model building and validation.

I recommend using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view the Jupyter Notebook.

* **Presentation**
The [presentation](https://) gives a high-level overview of our approach, findings and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. It is aimed to be between 5 and 10 minutes long.

* **Data**

The dataset can be found in the file *"kc_house_data.csv"* in the Data folder, in this repository. It was originally provided in the following [repository](https://github.com/Wairimukimm/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-3/blob/main/data/kc_house_data.csv).
